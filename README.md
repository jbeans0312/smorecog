This library takes a Spotify playlist and creates a visual representation of the playlist's overall vibe.

We use spotipy to fetch song information, and we take the following qualities into account:

### Danceability
- The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song.
### Energy
- The energy of a song, the higher the value, the more energetic.
### Loudness
- The higher the value, the louder the song (in dB).
### Acousticness
- The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.
### Instrumentalness
- This value represents the amount of vocals in the song.
### Valence
- The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song.
